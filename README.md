Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project is a clock that can be used by end users to view the time in both 12 and 24 hour format
What did you do particularly well?
In this project I was able to add a good amount of safeguards in case the end user enters the wrong command.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by being a bit more organized. I beileve I could shorten it a bit, and break things up into different groups.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most difficult portion to write was the time looping and staying consistent for both clocks, I used a bit of youtube and just general google/reddit searches to help me through this.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The organization of the code.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I left good notes/comments within the code explaining what different things do.
